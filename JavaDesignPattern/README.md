# Java Design Pattern

- Creational
  - Singleton (单例) - single alone~
  - Factory (工厂方法) - one factory creating multiple product.
  - Abstract Factory (抽象工厂) - same product but create by different multiple factories.
  - Prototype (clone) - Copy cat :)
  - Builder (建造者) Director - Builder - Product
- Structural
  - Adapter (适配器) Target Adapter implement Adaptee request
  - Bridge (桥接模式) ConcreteAbstraction implement the operation of the ConcreteImplementor. 
  - Composite (组合) CEO and his subordinates
  - Decorator (装饰) Pizza - Plain Pizza + Cheese
  - Facade (外观) ShapeMaker draw Circle/Rectangle/Square shape
  - Flyweight (享元模式) Reduce creating new object, using hashmap to prevent it, if there exist the object then reuse it.
  - Proxy (代理模式) help real subject doing request
- Behavioral
  - Chain Of Responsibility (责任链) handle request depends on request type
  - Command (命令) Invoker make a command to receiver, then receiver do the action
  - Iterator (迭代器) like container 
  - Observer (观察者模式) one to many, update status of observer
  - Strategy (策略) set a context to execute different strategy
  - Template Method (模板方法) like a game to handle the full process, just to override the initialize, start and end.
